### Running the Notebook

- This project was built using Jupyter Notebook and is compatible with Google Colab.

### To Run on Google Colab:
1. Open this notebook in Colab:  
   [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://github.com/shijin/CustomerBehaviorShoppingHabits-DataAnalysis-Python_R_SQL/blob/main/ConsumerBehavior_ShoppingHabits-DataAnalysis.ipynb)

2. Upload the dataset manually:  
   - Click the file icon (left sidebar in Colab)
   - Click **Upload**, then select `shopping_behavior.csv`  
   *(or run the cell `from google.colab import files` to upload interactively)*

3. Alternatively, replace the `read_csv()` line with a GitHub raw link:
```python
df = pd.read_csv('[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shijin/HeartDiseaseDataAnalysis-Python_SQL/main/heart.csv](https://github.com/shijin/BlackFridaySalesDataAnalysis-Python_R/blob/main/BlackFriday.csv)')
```
